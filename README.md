# APCSProject
Project for APCS, making repo to work on it at home and at school

also you can just, like, set a name for each of the components so it isn't stupidly hard to find them after.
use .setName() and then .getName() both provided by java.???.Component

Also, you can create a class called ButtonsFunctionality or something along those lines so "Buttons" isn't a class for all things buttons.
Well, I guess I should rename it to ButtonsSingleton and then make a ButtonsFunctionality? well, input wouldn't make a whole lotta sense then

Just leave it at Buttons and make it a singleton that provdes the buttons and its functionality.
